Nutri-AI is an agentic AI system to make nutritional information less daunting and accessible to all. 

It includes three agents: CsvTools Agent, Web Agent, and Reasoning Agent. 
The CsvTool Agent retrieves nutrition facts from a local CSV file, food.csv, via CsvTools. The file itself was acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food Composition Database. 
The Web Agent performs targeted web searches with GoogleSearchTools when local data is missing or needs verification and returns source links. Its main task is to locate alternative options for the user’s input, formatting the results as a list for easier readability. 
The Reasoning Agent compiles structured tables and concise takeaways using ReasoningTools into a comprehensible summary.

The code features two custom functions to run accuracy and performance tests. These ensure reliability and efficiency. 

The goal of the system is to encourage positive eating habits and to make nutrition more approachable. The future depends on health, and Nutri-AI is there to support it.
